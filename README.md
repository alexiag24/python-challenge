For pybank we have calculations and we are running a program based on these questions: 
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

I am still learning and was trying to create formulas to be able to come up with these answers but was not able to.
I was able to type it all out but was having trouble with the excel data being imput to the code. 

For pypoll it was similar our main objective was running a program based on these questions: 
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

Had the same thing happen where I am able to create a sort of blueprint of my code but was having trouble adding the file needed to be able to the 
correct calcuations.
